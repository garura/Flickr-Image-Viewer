# Flickr-Image-Viewer
This is a Flickr photo viewing app for the iPhone and iPad. Current top photo-taken locations are queried from Flickr, which are displayed in a list to the user, sorted by country. Clicking a location will query recent photos from that location and present a new list for the user, showing up to 50 photo titles and descriptions. Clicking on a photo name in the list will display the photo in a scrollable and zoomable format. All queries are done using Flickr's API, and are off the main thread. The app will work in either portrait or landscape mode.
